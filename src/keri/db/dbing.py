    gDbEnv.open_db(b'expire2uid', dupsort=True)  # expiration to uid anon

The dupsort, integerkey, integerdup, and dupfixed parameters are ignored
if the database already exists.
The state of those settings are persistent and immutable per database.
See _Database.flags() to view the state of those options for an opened database.
A consequence of the immutability of these flags is that the default non-named
database will never have these flags set.

So only need to set dupsort first time opened each other opening does not
need to call it


May want to use buffers for reads of immutable serializations such as events
and sigs. Anything not read modify write but read only.

        Assumes DB opened with dupsort=True

        Duplicates at a given key preserve insertion order of duplicate.
        Because lmdb is lexocographic an insertion ordering proem is prepended to
        all values that makes lexocographic order that same as insertion order
        Duplicates are ordered as a pair of key plus value so prepending proem
        to each value changes duplicate ordering. Proem is 33 characters long.
        With 32 character hex string followed by '.' for essentially unlimited
        number of values which will be limited by memory.

        Does a linear search so not very efficient when not deleting from the front.
        This is hack for supporting escrow which needs to delete individual dup.
        The problem is that escrow is not fixed buts stuffs gets added and
        deleted which just adds to the value of the proem. 2**16 is an impossibly
        large number so the proem will not max out practically. But its not
        and elegant solution. So maybe escrows need to use a different approach.
        But really didn't want to add another database just for escrows.
